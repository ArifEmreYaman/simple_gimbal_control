Codes I made with C

When you attach the Gyro sensor mpu 6050 and Servos to the Arduino in the right place, you can make your simple gimbal by running Gimbal_deneme_16.ino.


Gimbal 
Using the data received from the x, y and z axes from the gyro sensor mpu 6050, it allows the gimbal to be rotated in the yaw, roll and pitch directions using servos.With the simplified filter used, it is aimed to make the gimbal more stable.
